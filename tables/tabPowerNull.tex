\caption{The theoretical maximum number $\alpha N_c$ of rejections
of the null hypothesis for critical values of $\alpha$.
The number of comparisons is $N_c=100$,
each with the sample size of $N_o=1000$ observations.
Each histogram have $N_b=30$ equally spaced bins.
The $N_o$ values of $c_1'$ were calculated using simulations of
 power functions distributions with $a=0.3$.
The $N_o$ values of $c_2'$ were calculated using simulations of
 power functions distributions with $a=1$.
The $N_o$ values of $c_3'$ were calculated using simulations of
 power functions distributions with $a=2$.
The $N_o$ values of $c_4'$ were calculated using simulations of
 power functions distributions with $a=3$.
The $N_o$ values of $c_5'$ were calculated using simulations of
 power functions distributions with $a=4$.
Over all $N_c$ comparisons,
 $\mu(c_1')=0.7343$ and $\sigma(c_1')=0.2654$,
 $\mu(c_2')=0.8139$ and $\sigma(c_2')=0.2698$,
 $\mu(c_3')=0.7328$ and $\sigma(c_3')=0.2731$ .
 $\mu(c_4')=0.7623$ and $\sigma(c_4')=0.3053$ .
 $\mu(c_5')=0.7269$ and $\sigma(c_5')=0.1949$ .
